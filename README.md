A full-stack Pokémon battle simulator with authentic combat mechanics built with React and Express.
Pokémon: Battle Game (Web App) is an online battle simulator where players log in, select their Pokémon from a predefined roster, and face off against a randomly generated CPU team. The outcome of each battle is determined by the Pokémon's stats (like HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) and a special fight formula that calculates damage, type advantages, and critical hits. Build your strongest team, leverage type matchups, and outsmart the CPU to claim victory! Perfect for quick, strategic Pokémon battles in your browser. Pokedex API is used to fetch Pokémon data.
